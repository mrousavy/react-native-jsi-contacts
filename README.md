# react-native-jsi-contacts

The current **react-native-contacts** library uses the _React Native Bridge_ to convert the native Java/Objective-C types to JavaScript values. This is asynchronous, batched, and serializes the huge contacts list in the native world (write into `WritableArray`/`WritableMap`, then let the Bridge convert to JSON), then deserializes it on the JavaScript side using JSON. It is therefore slow.

react-native-jsi-contacts uses JSI to be way faster.

* Direct invocation (no batching!)
* No JSON serialization happening
* Directly convert object into JSI Types
* Lazily get individual Contact fields (`jsi::HostObject` lazy-get)

## Performance

The library uses the same native "`getContacts()`" function as [react-native-contacts](https://github.com/morenoh149/react-native-contacts), so the only difference is the conversion speed.

For 25 contacts, I have measured an average speed increase of ~35%, this greatly scales with the amount of contacts you have though.

```
 LOG  JSI: Contacts Permission: granted
 LOG  JSI: Got: 25 contacts in 55.14947900176048ms.
 LOG  Bridge: Contacts Permission: granted
 LOG  Bridge: Got: 25 contacts in 74.15260401368141ms.
```
